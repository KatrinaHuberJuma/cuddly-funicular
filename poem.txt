There’s a stake in your fat black heart
And the villagers never liked you.
They are dancing and stamping on you.
They always knew it was you.
Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I’m through.

The apparition of these faces in the crowd:
Petals on a wet, black bough.

There was once a dame from Nob Hill.
She thought making apps was a thrill.
So she went to Hackbright.
Where her skills all took flight.
And pair programming was hella chill.

I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

We would rather be ruined than changed
We would rather die in our dread
Than climb the cross of the moment
And let our illusions die.
STOP HERE
(this line never gets printed)
